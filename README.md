## Synopsis
The product we are to build consists of a web application that allows users to query and view various maps that represent “natural and anthropogenic stresses” (compounds that are added to the ecosystem). Based off of ASCII files provided by Prof. Chaoqun Lu, our goal is provide an easy and automated way to generate visutally stunning maps of various compounds and create a platform that will allow dynamic loading of said maps onto a 3D space.

## Motivation
The Visual Earth Modeling System will allow various policy makers (government, grant societies, etc.) and land managers (real-estate, governmental, farmers, etc.) to visually examine, further analyze, and understand spatial patterns of various gas compounds, water discharges, and nutrient movement. Allowing these stakeholders to further understand the environment will aid them in making decisions in reference to pollution policy, development of land to be used for various crops, grant making, etc.
